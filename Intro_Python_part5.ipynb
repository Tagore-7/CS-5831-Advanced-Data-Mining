        "It turns out that generating lists with a specific number of integers is a very common thing to do, especially when you want to write simple ``for loop`` controlled iteration.  Even though you can use any four items, or any four integers for that matter, the conventional thing to do is to use a list of integers starting with 0. In fact, these lists are so popular that Python gives us special built-in ``range`` objects that can deliver a sequence of values to the ``for`` loop.  When called with one parameter, the sequence provided by ``range`` always starts with 0.  If you ask for ``range(4)``, then you will get 4 values starting with 0.  In other words, 0, 1, 2, and finally 3.  Notice that 4 is not included since we started with 0.  Likewise, ``range(10)`` provides 10 values, 0 through 9.\n",

        "The [range](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/functions.html#func-range) function is actually a very powerful function when it comes to creating sequences of integers.  It can take one, two, or three parameters.  We have seen the simplest case of one parameter such as ``range(4)`` which creates ``[0, 1, 2, 3]``.  But what if we really want to have the sequence ``[1, 2, 3, 4]``?  We can do this by using a two parameter version of ``range`` where the first parameter is the starting point and the second parameter is the ending point.  The evaluation of ``range(1,5)`` produces the desired sequence.  What happened to the 5? In this case we interpret the parameters of the range function to mean range(start,beyondLast), where beyondLast means an index past the last index we want.  In the 2-parameter version of range, that is the last index included + 1.\n",

Because computer scientists like to start counting at 0 instead of 1, ``range(N)`` produces a sequence of things that is N long, but the consequence of this is that the final number of the sequence is N-1.  In the case of start, stop it helps to simply think that the sequence begins with start and continues as long as the number is less than stop.\n",

For example, to compute the sum of the first n integers, we could create a for loop using the ``range`` to produce the numbers 1 through n. Using the accumulator pattern, we can start with a running total variable initialized to 0 and on each iteration, add the current value of the loop variable.  A function to compute this sum is shown below."

To to this, we will create a variable called ``aNumber`` and initialize it to 1, the first number in the summation.  Every iteration will add ``aNumber`` to the running total until all the values have been used. In order to control the iteration, we must create a boolean expression that evaluates to ``True`` as long as we want to keep adding values to our running total.  In this case, as long as ``aNumber`` is less than or equal to the bound, we should keep going.\n",

Since we know that it will iterate once for each value in the collection, it is often said that a ``for`` loop creates a **definite iteration** because we definitely know how many times we are going to iterate.  On the other  hand, the ``while`` statement is dependent on a condition that needs to evaluate to ``False`` in order for the loop to terminate.  Since we do not necessarily know when this will happen, it creates what we call **indefinite iteration**.  Indefinite iteration simply means that we don't know how many times we will repeat but eventually the condition controlling the iteration will fail and the iteration will stop. (Unless we have an infinite loop which is of course a problem.)\n",

        "One of the things loops are good for is generating tabular data.  Before computers were readily available, people had to calculate logarithms, sines and cosines, and other mathematical functions by hand. To make that easier, mathematics books contained long tables listing the values of these functions. Creating the tables was slow and boring, and they tended to be full of errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "When computers appeared on the scene, one of the initial reactions was, *\"This is great! We can use the computers to generate the tables, so there will be no errors.\"* That turned out to be true (mostly) but shortsighted. Soon thereafter, computers and calculators were so pervasive that the tables became obsolete.\n",
        "\n",
        "Well, almost. For some operations, computers use tables of values to get an approximate answer and then perform computations to improve the approximation. In some cases, there have been errors in the underlying tables, most famously in the table the Intel Pentium processor chip used to perform floating-point division.\n",
