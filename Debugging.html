<h1 id="debugging">Debugging</h1>
<p>Materials adapted from <em><a href="https://runestone.academy/runestone/static/thinkcspy/index.html">How
to Think Like a Computer Scientist</a></em></p>
<p>This page is paired with the Jupyter Notebook:
Intro-Python-part2.ipynb</p>
<p>One of the most important skills you need to acquire is the ability
to debug your programs. Debugging might be the most under-appreciated,
and under-taught, skill in introductory computer science. For that
reason we are introducing a series of “debugging interludes.” Debugging
is a skill that you need to master over time, and some of the tips and
tricks are specific to different aspects of Python programming. So look
for additional debugging interludes throughout the rest of this
module.</p>
<p>Programming is an odd thing in a way. Here is why. As programmers we
spend 99% of our time trying to get our program to work. We struggle, we
stress, we spend hours deep in frustration trying to get our program to
execute correctly. Then when we do get it going we celebrate, hand it
in, and move on to the next homework assignment or programming task. But
here is the secret, when you are successful, you are happy, your brain
releases a bit of chemical that makes you feel good. You need to
organize your programming so that you have lots of little successes. It
turns out your brain doesn’t care all that much if you have successfully
written hello world, or a fast Fourier transform (trust me its hard) you
still get that little release that makes you happy. When you are happy
you want to go on and solve the next little problem. Essentially I’m
telling you once again, start small, get something small working, and
then add to it.</p>
<h1 id="how-to-avoid-degugging">How to Avoid Degugging</h1>
<p>Perhaps the most important lesson in debugging is that it is
<strong>largely avoidable</strong> – if you work carefully.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Understand the Problem</strong> You must have a firm
grasp on <strong>what</strong> you are trying to accomplish but not
necessarily <strong>how</strong> to do it. You do not need to understand
the entire problem. But you must understand at least a portion of it and
what the program should do in a specific circumstance – what output
should be produced for some given input. This will allow you to test
your progress. You can then identify if a solution is correct or whether
there remains work to do or bugs to fix. This is probably the single
biggest piece of advice for programmers at every level.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Start Small</strong> It is tempting to sit down and crank
out an entire program at once. But, when the program – inevitably – does
not work, you have a myriad of options for things that might be wrong.
Where to start? Where to look first? How to figure out what went wrong?
I’ll get to that in the next section. So, start with something really
small. Maybe just two lines and then make sure that runs. Hitting the
run button is quick and easy. It gives you immediate feedback about
whether what you have just done works or not. Another immediate benefit
of having something small working is that you have something to turn in.
Turning in a small, incomplete program, is almost always better than
nothing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Keep Improving It</strong> Once you have a small part of
your program working, the next step is to figure out something small to
add to it – how can you move closer to a correct solution. As you add to
your program, you gain greater insight into the underlying problem you
are trying to solve.<br>
If you keep adding small pieces of the program one at a time, it is much
easier to figure out what went wrong. (This of course means you must be
able to recognize if there is an error. And that is done through
testing.)<br>
As long as you always test each new bit of code, it is most likely that
any error is in the new code you have just added. Less new code means
its easier to figure out where the problem is.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This notion of <strong>Get something working and keep improving
it</strong> is a mantra that you can repeat throughout your career as a
programmer. It’s a great way to avoid the frustrations mentioned above.
Think of it this way. Every time you have a little success, your brain
releases a tiny bit of chemical that makes you happy. So, you can keep
yourself happy and make programming more enjoyable by creating lots of
small victories for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong><br>
The technique of start small and keep improving is the basis of
<strong>Agile</strong> software development. This practice is used
widely in the industry.</p>
<h3 id="example-1---debugging">Example 1 - Debugging</h3>
<p>Ok, let’s look at an example. Ask the user for the time now (in hours
0 - 23), and ask for the number of hours to wait. Your program should
output what the time will be on the clock when the alarm goes off. For
example, if <code>current_time</code> is 8 and <code>wait_time</code> is
5, <code>final_time</code> should be 13 (1 pm).</p>
<p>So, where to start? The problem requires two pieces of input from the
user, so let’s start there and make sure we can get the data we
need.</p>

<p>So far so good. Now let’s take the next step. We need to figure out
what the time will be after waiting <code>wait_time</code> number of
hours. A reasonable solution is to simply add <code>wait_time</code> to
<code>current_time</code> and print out the result. So lets try
that.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="https://pages.mtu.edu/~lebrown/cs4821-cs5831-s24/Intro2Python/2-Debugging.html#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>current_time <span class="op">=</span> <span class="bu">input</span>(<span class="st">"What is the current time (in hours 0 - 23)?"</span>)</span>

<p>Hmm, when you run this example you see that something unexpected has
happened. You would not realize this was an error unless you first knew
what the program was supposed to do.</p>
<p>This error was probably pretty simple to spot, because we printed out
the value of <code>final_time</code> and it is easy to see that the
numbers were just concatenated together rather than added.</p>
<p>So what do we do about the problem? We will need to convert both
<code>current_time</code> and <code>wait_time</code> to
<code>int</code>. At this stage of your programming development, it can
be a good idea to include the type of the variable in the variable name
itself. So let’s look at another iteration of the program that does
that, and the conversion to integer.</p>

<p>Now, that’s a lot better, and in fact depending on the hours you
chose, it may be exactly right. If you entered 8 for
<code>current_time</code> and 5 for <code>wait_time</code> then 13 is
correct. But if you entered 17 (5 pm) for <code>current_time</code> and
9 for <code>wait_time</code> then the result of 26 is not correct.</p>
<p>This illustrates an important aspect of <strong>testing</strong>: it
is important to test your code on a range of inputs. It is especially
important to test your code on <strong>boundary conditions</strong>. For
this particular problem, you should test your program with
<code>current_time</code> of 0, 23, and some values in between. You
should test your <code>wait_time</code> for 0, and some larger values.
What about negative numbers? Negative numbers don’t make sense, and
since we don’t really have the tools to deal with telling the user when
something is wrong we will not worry about that just yet.</p>
<p>So to account for those numbers that are bigger than 23, we need one
final step: using the modulus operator.</p>

<p>Of course even in this simple progression, there are other ways you
could have gone astray. We’ll look at some of those and how you track
them down in the next section.</p>
<h1 id="beginning-tips-for-debugging">Beginning Tips for Debugging</h1>
<p>Debugging a program is a different way of thinking than writing a
program. The process of debugging is much more like being a detective.
Here are a few rules to get you thinking about debugging.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Everyone is a suspect (Except Python)! It’s common for beginner
programmers to blame Python, but that should be your last resort.
Remember that Python has been used to solve CS1 level problems millions
of times by millions of other programmers. So, Python is probably not
the problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Find clues. This is the biggest job of the detective and right
now there are two important kinds of clues for you to understand.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Error Messages</p></li>
<li><p>Print Statements</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="know-your-error-messages">Know Your Error Messages</h1>
<p>Many problems in your program will lead to an error message. For
example, look at the following version of the example program in the
previous section.</p>
<pre><code>current_time_str = input("What is the current time (in hours 0-23)?")
wait_time_str = input("How many hours do you want to wait")

current_time_int = int(current_time_str)
wait_time_int = int(wait_time_int)

final_time_int = current_time_int + wait_time_int
print(final_time_int)</code></pre>
<p>Can you see what is wrong, just by looking at the code? Maybe, maybe
not. Our brain tends to see what we think is there, so sometimes it is
very hard to find the problem just by looking at the code. Especially
when it is our own code and we are sure that we have done everything
right!</p>
<p>Let’s try to run the program again!</p>
<p>Aha! Now we have an error message that might be useful. The name
error tells us that <code>wait_time_int</code> is not defined. It also
tells us that the error is on line 5. That’s <strong>really</strong>
useful information. Now look at line five and you will see that
<code>wait_time_int</code> is used on both the left and the right hand
side of the assignment statement.</p>
<p>In writing the book, <em>How to Think Like a Computer Scientist</em>,
the authors kept track of types of errors in the exercises. Nearly 90%
of the error messages encountered for this problem are ParseError,
TypeError, NameError, or ValueError. We will look at these errors in
three stages:</p>
<ul>
<li>First we will define what these four error messages mean.</li>
<li>Then, we will look at some examples that cause these errors to
occur.</li>
<li>Finally we will look at ways to help uncover the root cause of these
messages.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="syntaxerror">SyntaxError</h2>
<p>Syntax errors, or parse errors, happen when you make an error in the
syntax of your program. Syntax errors are like making grammatical errors
in writing. If you don’t use periods and commas in your writing then you
are making it hard for other readers to figure out what you are trying
to say. Similarly Python has certain grammatical rules that must be
followed or else Python can’t figure out what you are trying to say.</p>
<p>Usually SyntaxErrors can be traced back to missing punctuation
characters, such as parentheses, quotation marks, or commas. Remember
that in Python commas are used to separate parameters to functions.
Parentheses must be balanced, or else Python thinks that you are trying
to include everything that follows as a parameter to some function.</p>
<p>Here are a couple examples of Parse errors in the example program we
have been using. See if you can figure out what caused them.</p>

<p><strong>Finding Clues</strong> How can you help yourself find these
problems? One trick that can be very valuable in this situation is to
simply start by commenting out the line number that is flagged as having
the error. If you comment out line four, the error message now changes
to point to line 5. Now you ask yourself, am I really that bad that I
have two lines in a row that have errors on them? Maybe, so taken to the
extreme, you could comment out all of the remaining lines in the
program. Now the error message changes to
<code>TokenError: EOF in multi-line statement</code> This is a very
technical way of saying that Python got to the end of file (EOF) while
it was still looking for something. In this case a right
parenthesis.</p>

<p><strong>Finding Clues</strong> If you follow the same advice as for
the last problem, comment out line one, you will immediately get a
different error message. Here’s where you need to be very careful and
not panic. The error message you get now is:
<code>NameError: name 'current_time_str' is not defined on line 4</code>.
You might be very tempted to think that this is somehow related to the
earlier problem and immediately conclude that there is something wrong
with the variable name <code>current_time_str</code> but if you reflect
for a minute you will see that by commenting out line one you have
caused a new and unrelated error. That is you have commented out the
creation of the name <code>current_time_str</code>. So of course when
you want to convert it to an <code>int</code> you will get the
NameError. Yes, this can be confusing, but it will become much easier
with experience. It’s also important to keep calm, and evaluate each new
clue carefully so you don’t waste time chasing problems that are not
really there.</p>
<p>Uncomment line 1 and you are back to the SyntaxError. Another track
is to eliminate a possible source of error. Rather than commenting out
the entire line you might just try to assign
<code>current_time_str</code> to a constant value. For example you might
make line one look like this:
<code>current_time_str = "10"  #input("What is the "current time" (in hours 0-23)?")</code>.
Now you have assigned <code>current_time_str</code> to the string 10,
and commented out the input statement. And now the program works! So you
conclude that the problem must have something to do with the input
function.</p>
<h2 id="typeerror">TypeError</h2>
<p>TypeErrors occur when you you try to combine two objects that are not
compatible. For example you try to add together an integer and a string.
Usually type errors can be isolated to lines that are using mathematical
operators, and usually the line number given by the error message is an
accurate indication of the line.</p>

<p><strong>Finding Clues</strong> One thing that can help you in this
situation is to print out the values and the types of the variables
involved in the statement that is causing the error. You might try
adding a print statement after line 4 <code>print(x, type(x))</code> You
will see that at least we have confirmed that x is of type string. Now
you need to start to work backward through the program. You need to ask
yourself, where is x used in the program? x is used on lines 2, 3, and
of course 5 and 6 (where we are getting an error). So maybe you move the
print statement to be after line 2 and again after 3. Line 3 is where
you expect the value of x to be changed to an integer. Could line 4 be
mysteriously changing x back to a string? Not very likely. So the value
and type of x is just what you would expect it to be after line 2, but
not after line 3. This helps you isolate the problem to line 3. In fact
if you employ one of our earlier techniques of commenting out line 3 you
will see that this has no impact on the error, and is a big clue that
line 3 as it is currently written is useless.</p>
<h2 id="nameerror">NameError</h2>
<p>Name errors almost always mean that you have used a variable before
it has a value. Often NameErrors are simply caused by typos in your
code. They can be hard to spot if you don’t have a good eye for catching
spelling mistakes. Other times you may simply mis-remember the name of a
variable or even a function you want to call. You have seen one example
of a NameError at the beginning of this section. Here is another one.

<p><strong>Finding Clues</strong> With name errors one of the best
things you can do is use the editor, or browser search function. Quite
often if you search for the exact word in the error message one of two
things will happen:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The word you are searching for will appear only once in your
code, it’s also likely that it will be on the right hand side of an
assignment statement, or as a parameter to a function. That should
confirm for you that you have a typo somewhere. If the name in question
<strong>is</strong> what you thought it should be then you probably have
a typo on the left hand side of an assignment statement on a line before
your error message occurs. Start looking backward at your assignment
statements. In some cases it’s really nice to leave all the highlighted
strings from the search function visible as they will help you very
quickly find a line where you might have expected your variable to be
highlighted.</p></li>
<li><p>The second thing that may happen is that you will be looking
directly at a line where you expected the search to find the string in
question, but it will not be highlighted. Most often that will be the
typo right there.</p></li>

<h2 id="value-error">Value Error</h2>
<p>Value errors occur when you pass a parameter to a function and the
function is expecting a certain limitations on the values, and the value
passed is not compatible. We can illustrate that with this particular
program in two different ways.</p>
<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<p>Run the program but instead of typing in anything to the dialog box
just click OK. You should see the following error message:
<code>ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '' on line: 4</code>
This error is not because you have made a mistake in your program.
Although sometimes we do want to check the user input to make sure its
valid, but we don’t have all the tools we need for that yet. The error
happens because the user did not give us something we can convert to an
integer, instead we gave it an empty string. Try running the program
again. Now this time enter “ten” instead of the number 10. You will get
a similar error message.</p>
