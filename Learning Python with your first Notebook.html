<h2 id="the-python-programming-language">The Python Programming
Language</h2>
<p>The programming language you will be learning is Python. Python is an
example of a <strong>high-level language</strong>; other high-level
languages you might have heard of are Matlab, C++, PHP, and Java.</p>
<p>As you might infer from the name high-level language, there are also
<strong>low-level languages</strong>, sometimes referred to as machine
languages or assembly languages. Machine language is the encoding of
instructions in binary so that they can be directly executed by the
computer. Assembly language uses a slightly easier format to refer to
the low level instructions. Loosely speaking, computers can only execute
programs written in low-level languages. To be exact, computers can
actually only execute programs written in machine language. Thus,
programs written in a high-level language (and even those in assembly
language) have to be processed before they can run. This extra
processing takes some time, which is a small disadvantage of high-level
languages. However, the advantages to high-level languages are
enormous.</p>
<p>First, it is much easier to program in a high-level language.
Programs written in a high-level language take less time to write, they
are shorter and easier to read, and they are more likely to be correct.
Second, high-level languages are <strong>portable</strong>, meaning that
they can run on different kinds of computers with few or no
modifications. Low-level programs can run on only one kind of computer
and have to be rewritten to run on another.</p>
<p>Due to these advantages, almost all programs are written in
high-level languages. Low-level languages are used only for a few
specialized applications.</p>
<!-- Two kinds of programs process high-level languages into low-level languages: **interpreters** and **compilers**. An interpreter reads a high-level program and executes it, meaning that it does what the program says. It processes the program a little at a time, alternately reading lines and performing computations.

![Interpret illustration](figs/interpret.png)

A compiler reads the program and translates it completely before the program starts running. In this case, the high-level program is called the **source code**, and the translated program is called the **object code** or the **executable**. Once a program is compiled, you can execute it repeatedly without further translation.

<h1 id="exploring-python-in-a-jupyter-notebook">Exploring Python in a
Jupyter Notebook</h1>
<p>We will be learning about Python by using a Jupyter notebook. You
will be given a starter notebook <code>Intro-Python-part1.ipynb</code>,
that contains some text and code, which you will add to.</p>
<p>Download the file <code>Intro-Python-part1.ipynb</code> from Canvas
and move it to open it with Jupyter Lab (or another IDE, e.g., PyCharm,
VS, or an online system such as Google Colaboratory).</p>
<p>You should follow along reading through this page, executing and
modifying code in your IDE.</p>
<h2 id="python-code">Python Code</h2>
<p>A <strong>program</strong> is a sequence of instructions that
specifies how to perform a computation. We can think about our
<strong>code cells</strong> also as a sequence of instructions. The
computation might be something as complex as rendering an html page in a
web browser or encoding a video and streaming it across the network. It
can also be a symbolic computation, such as searching for and replacing
text in a document or (strangely enough) compiling a program.</p>
<p>The details look different in different languages, but a few basic
instructions appear in just about every language.</p>
<dl>
<dt>input</dt>
<dd>
Get data from the keyboard, a file, or some other device.
</dd>
<dt>output</dt>
<dd>
Display data on the screen or send data to a file or other device.
</dd>
<dt>math and logic</dt>
<dd>
Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and multiplication
and logical operations like <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and
<code>not</code>.
</dd>
<dt>conditional execution</dt>
<dd>
Check for certain conditions and execute the appropriate sequence of
statements.
</dd>
<dt>repetition</dt>
<dd>
Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Believe it or not, that’s pretty much all there is to it. Every
program you’ve ever used, no matter how complicated, is made up of
instructions that look more or less like these. Thus, we can describe
programming as the process of breaking a large, complex task into
smaller and smaller subtasks until the subtasks are simple enough to be
performed with sequences of these basic instructions.</p>
<h3 id="debugging">Debugging</h3>
<p>Programming is a complex process. Since it is done by human beings,
errors may often occur. Programming errors are called
<strong>bugs</strong> and the process of tracking them down and
correcting them is called <strong>debugging</strong>. Some claim that in
1945, a dead moth caused a problem on relay number 70, panel F, of one
of the first computers at Harvard, and the term <strong>bug</strong> has
remained in use since. For more about this historic event, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:H96566k.jpg">first bug</a>.</p>
<p>Three kinds of errors can occur in a program: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_error">syntax errors</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_error">runtime errors</a>,
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_error">semantic
errors</a>. It is useful to distinguish between them in order to track
them down more quickly.</p>
<h4 id="syntax-errors">Syntax Errors</h4>
<p>Python can only execute a program if the program is syntactically
correct; otherwise, the process fails and returns an error message.
<strong>Syntax</strong> refers to the structure of a program and the
rules about that structure. For example, in English, a sentence must
begin with a capital letter and end with a period. this sentence
contains a <strong>syntax error</strong>. So does this one</p>
<p>For most readers, a few syntax errors are not a significant problem,
which is why we can read the poetry of e. e. cummings without problems.
Python is not so forgiving. If there is a single syntax error anywhere
in your code cell, Python will display an error message, not completing
the desired execution. During the first few weeks of your programming
career, you will probably spend a lot of time tracking down syntax
errors. However, as you gain experience, you will make fewer errors and
you will also be able to find your errors faster.</p>
<h4 id="runtime-errors">Runtime Errors</h4>
<p>The second type of error is a runtime error, so called because the
error does not appear until you run the program. These errors are also
called <strong>exceptions</strong> because they usually indicate that
something exceptional (and bad) has happened.</p>
<h4 id="semantic-errors">Semantic Errors</h4>
<p>The third type of error is the <strong>semantic error</strong>. If
there is a semantic error in your program, it will run successfully in
the sense that the computer will not generate any error messages.
However, your program will not do the right thing. It will do something
else. Specifically, it will do what you told it to do.</p>
<p>The problem is that the program you wrote is not the program you
wanted to write. The meaning of the program (its semantics) is wrong.
Identifying semantic errors can be tricky because it requires you to
work backward by looking at the output of the program and trying to
figure out what it is doing.</p>
<h4 id="debugging-skills">Debugging Skills</h4>
<p>One of the most important skills you will acquire is debugging.
Although it can be frustrating, debugging is one of the most
intellectually rich, challenging, and interesting parts of
programming.</p>
<p>In some ways, debugging is like detective work. You are confronted
with clues, and you have to infer the processes and events that led to
the results you see.</p>
<p>Debugging is also like an experimental science. Once you have an idea
what is going wrong, you modify your program and try again. If your
hypothesis was correct, then you can predict the result of the
modification, and you take a step closer to a working program. If your
hypothesis was wrong, you have to come up with a new one. As Sherlock
Holmes pointed out, When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever
remains, however improbable, must be the truth. (A. Conan Doyle, <em>The
Sign of Four</em>)</p>
<p>For some people, programming and debugging are the same thing. That
is, programming is the process of gradually debugging a program until it
does what you want. The idea is that you should start with a program
that does <em>something</em> and make small modifications, debugging
them as you go, so that you always have a working program.</p>
<h3 id="example-1---a-typical-first-program">Example 1 - A typical first
program</h3>
<p>Traditionally, the first program written in a new language is called
<em>Hello, World!</em> because all it does is display the words, Hello,
World! In Python, the source code looks like this.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="https://pages.mtu.edu/~lebrown/cs4821-cs5831-s24/Intro2Python/1-Learning-Python-with-your-first-notebook.html#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="bu">print</span>(<span class="st">"Hello, World!"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is an example of using the <code>print</code> function, which
doesn’t actually print anything on paper. It displays a value on the
screen. In this case, the result is the phrase:</p>
<pre><code>Hello, World!</code></pre>
<h3 id="comments">Comments</h3>
<p>As programs get bigger and more complicated, they get more difficult
to read. It is often difficult to look at a piece of code and figure out
what it is doing, or why. For this reason, it is a good idea to add
notes to your programs to explain in natural language what the program
is doing. These notes are called comments.</p>
<p>A <strong>comment</strong> in a computer program is text that is
intended only for the human reader - it is completely ignored by the
interpreter. In Python, the <code>#</code> token starts a comment. The
rest of the line is ignored. Here is a new version of <em>Hello,
World!</em>.</p>

<h4 id="example-2---printing">Example 2 - Printing</h4>
<p>Try running the above code into a new code cell in your notebook and
observe what is printed.</p>
<p>Notice that when you run this program, it still only prints the
phrase Hello, World! None of the comments appear. You’ll also notice
that we’ve left a blank line in the program. Blank lines are also
ignored by the interpreter, but comments and blank lines can make your
programs much easier for humans to parse. Use them liberally!</p>
<h1 id="python-terminology-and-code">Python Terminology and Code</h1>
<p>In order to get started learning any programming language there are a
number of concepts and ideas that are necessary. The goal of this
section is to introduce you to the basic vocabulary of programming and
some of the fundamental building blocks of Python.</p>
<h2 id="values-and-data-types">Values and Data Types</h2>
<p>A <strong>value</strong> is one of the fundamental things — like a
word or a number — that a program manipulates. The values we have seen
so far are <code>5</code> (the result when we added <code>2 + 3</code>),
and <code>"Hello, World!"</code>. We often refer to these values as
<strong>objects</strong> and we will use the words value and object
interchangeably.</p>
<p>These objects are classified into different <strong>classes</strong>,
or <strong>data types</strong>: <code>4</code> is an <em>integer</em>,
and <code>"Hello, World!"</code> is a <em>string</em>, so-called because
it contains a string or sequence of letters. You (and the interpreter)
can identify strings because they are enclosed in quotation marks.</p>
<p>If you are not sure what class a value falls into, Python has a
function called <strong>type</strong> which can tell you.</p>
<h3 id="example-3---data-types">Example 3 - Data Types</h3>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="https://pages.mtu.edu/~lebrown/cs4821-cs5831-s24/Intro2Python/1-Learning-Python-with-your-first-notebook.html#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="bu">print</span>(<span class="bu">type</span>(<span class="st">"Hello, World!"</span>))</span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="https://pages.mtu.edu/~lebrown/cs4821-cs5831-s24/Intro2Python/1-Learning-Python-with-your-first-notebook.html#cb4-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="bu">print</span>(<span class="bu">type</span>(<span class="dv">17</span>))</span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a href="https://pages.mtu.edu/~lebrown/cs4821-cs5831-s24/Intro2Python/1-Learning-Python-with-your-first-notebook.html#cb4-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="bu">print</span>(<span class="st">"Hello, World"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Not surprisingly, strings belong to the class <strong>str</strong>
and integers belong to the class <strong>int</strong>.</p>
<p>Continuing with our discussion of data types, numbers with a decimal
point belong to a class called <strong>float</strong>, because these
numbers are represented in a format called <em>floating-point</em>. At
this stage, you can treat the words <em>class</em> and <em>type</em>
interchangeably. We’ll come back to a deeper understanding of what a
class is later.</p>
<h3 id="example-4---data-types">Example 4 - Data Types</h3>
<p>What about values like “17” and “3.2”? They look like numbers, but
they are in quotation marks like strings.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="https://pages.mtu.edu/~lebrown/cs4821-cs5831-s24/Intro2Python/1-Learning-Python-with-your-first-notebook.html#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="bu">print</span>(<span class="bu">type</span>(<span class="st">"17"</span>))</span>

<p>They’re strings!</p>
<p>Strings in Python can be enclosed in either single quotes
(<code>'</code>) or double quotes (<code>"</code> - the double quote
character), or three of the same separate quote characters
(<code>'''</code> or <code>"""</code>).</p>
<h3 id="example-5---strings">Example 5 - Strings</h3>
<p>Double quoted strings can contain single quotes inside them, as in
“Bruce’s beard”, and single quoted strings can have double quotes inside
them, as in ‘The knights who say “Ni!”’. Strings enclosed with three
occurrences of either quote symbol are called triple quoted strings.
They can contain either single or double quotes:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb6-1"><a href="https://pages.mtu.edu/~lebrown/cs4821-cs5831-s24/Intro2Python/1-Learning-Python-with-your-first-notebook.html#cb6-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="bu">print</span>(<span class="st">'''"Oh no", she exclaimed, "Ben's bike is broken!"'''</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Triple quoted strings can even span multiple lines:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb7-1"><a href="https://pages.mtu.edu/~lebrown/cs4821-cs5831-s24/Intro2Python/1-Learning-Python-with-your-first-notebook.html#cb7-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="bu">print</span>(<span class="st">"""This message will span</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2"><a href="https://pages.mtu.edu/~lebrown/cs4821-cs5831-s24/Intro2Python/1-Learning-Python-with-your-first-notebook.html#cb7-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="st">several lines</span></span>
<span id="cb7-3"><a href="https://pages.mtu.edu/~lebrown/cs4821-cs5831-s24/Intro2Python/1-Learning-Python-with-your-first-notebook.html#cb7-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="st">of the text."""</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Python doesn’t care whether you use single or double quotes or the
three-of-a-kind quotes to surround your strings. Once it has parsed the
text of your program or command, the way it stores the value is
identical in all cases, and the surrounding quotes are not part of the
value.</p>
<p>So the Python language designers usually chose to surround their
strings by single quotes. What do you think would happen if the string
already contained single quotes?</p>
<h3 id="example-6---printing">Example 6 - Printing</h3>
<p>When you type a large integer, you might be tempted to use commas
between groups of three digits, as in <code>42,000</code>. This is not a
legal integer in Python, but it does mean something else, which is
legal:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb8-1"><a href="https://pages.mtu.edu/~lebrown/cs4821-cs5831-s24/Intro2Python/1-Learning-Python-with-your-first-notebook.html#cb8-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="bu">print</span>(<span class="dv">42000</span>)</span>
<span id="cb8-2"><a href="https://pages.mtu.edu/~lebrown/cs4821-cs5831-s24/Intro2Python/1-Learning-Python-with-your-first-notebook.html#cb8-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="bu">print</span>(<span class="dv">42</span>,<span class="dv">000</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Well, that’s not what we expected at all! Because of the comma,
Python chose to treat this as a <em>pair</em> of values. In fact, the
print function can print any number of values as long as you separate
them by commas. Notice that the values are separated by spaces when they

<h2 id="type-conversion-functions">Type conversion functions</h2>
<p>Sometimes it is necessary to convert values from one type to another.
Python provides a few simple functions that will allow us to do that.
The functions <code>int</code>, <code>float</code> and <code>str</code>
will (attempt to) convert their arguments into types <code>int</code>,
<code>float</code> and <code>str</code> respectively. We call these
<strong>type conversion</strong> functions.</p>
<h3 id="example-7---convert-to-int">Example 7 - Convert to int</h3>
<p>The <code>int</code> function can take a floating point number or a
string, and turn it into an int. For floating point numbers, it
<em>discards</em> the decimal portion of the number - a process we call
<em>truncation towards zero</em> on the number line. Let us see this in
action:</p>

<h2 id="variables">Variables</h2>
<p>One of the most powerful features of a programming language is the
ability to manipulate <strong>variables</strong>. A variable is a name
that refers to a value.</p>
<p><strong>Assignment statements</strong> create new variables and also
give them values to refer to.</p>
<h3 id="example-10---variables">Example 10 - Variables</h3>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb13"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb13-1"><a href="https://pages.mtu.edu/~lebrown/cs4821-cs5831-s24/Intro2Python/1-Learning-Python-with-your-first-notebook.html#cb13-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>message <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"What's up, Doc?"</span></span>

<p>This example makes three assignments. The first assigns the string
value <code>"What's up, Doc?"</code> to a new variable named
<code>message</code>. The second gives the integer <code>17</code> to
<code>n</code>, and the third assigns the floating-point number
<code>3.14159</code> to a variable called <code>pi</code>.</p>
<p>The <strong>assignment token</strong>, <code>=</code>, should not be
confused with <em>equality</em> (we will see later that equality uses
the <code>==</code> token). The assignment statement links a
<em>name</em>, on the left hand side of the operator, with a
<em>value</em>, on the right hand side. This is why you will get an
error if you enter:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb14"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb14-1"><a href="https://pages.mtu.edu/~lebrown/cs4821-cs5831-s24/Intro2Python/1-Learning-Python-with-your-first-notebook.html#cb14-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="dv">17</span> <span class="op">=</span> n </span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Tip</strong> When reading or writing code, say to yourself “n
is assigned 17” or “n gets the value 17” or “n is a reference to the
object 17” or “n refers to the object 17”. Don’t say “n equals 17”.</p>
<p>A common way to represent variables on paper is to write the name
with an arrow pointing to the variable’s value. This kind of figure,
known as a reference diagram, is often called a state snapshot because
it shows what state each of the variables is in at a particular instant
in time. (Think of it as the variable’s state of mind). This diagram
shows the result of executing the assignment statements shown above.</p>

<p>If you ask Python to evaluate a variable, it will produce the value
that is currently linked to the variable. In other words, evaluating a
variable will give you the value that is referred to by the
variable.</p>

<p>The type of a variable is the type of the object it currently refers
to.</p>
<p>We use variables in a program to “remember” things, like the current
score at the football game. But variables are <em>variable</em>. This
means they can change over time, just like the scoreboard at a football
game. You can assign a value to a variable, and later assign a different
value to the same variable.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong><br>
This is different from math. In math, if you give <code>x</code> the
value 3, it cannot change to refer to a different value half-way through
your calculations!</p>
<h3 id="example-12---variables">Example 12 - Variables</h3>
<p>To see this, read and then run the following program. You’ll notice
we change the value of <code>day</code> three times, and on the third
assignment we even give it a value that is of a different type.</p>

<p>A great deal of programming is about having the computer remember
things. For example, we might want to keep track of the number of missed
calls on your phone. Each time another call is missed, we will arrange
to update or change the variable so that it will always reflect the
correct value.</p>
<h2 id="variable-names-and-keywords">Variable Names and Keywords</h2>
<p><strong>Variable names</strong> can be arbitrarily long. They can
contain both letters and digits, but they have to begin with a letter or
an underscore. Although it is legal to use uppercase letters, by
convention we don’t. If you do, remember that case matters.
<code>Bruce</code> and <code>bruce</code> are different variables. <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#naming-conventions">Python
naming conventions</a> typically has variables using lower case letters
and underscores.</p>
<p><strong>Caution</strong>:<br>
Variable names can never contain spaces.</p>
<p>The underscore character ( <code>_</code>) can also appear in a name.
It is often used in names with multiple words, such as
<code>my_name</code> or <code>price_of_tea_in_china</code>. There are
some situations in which names beginning with an underscore have special
meaning, so a safe rule for beginners is to start all names with a
letter.</p>
<h3 id="example-13---variable-names">Example 13 - Variable Names</h3>
<p>If you give a variable an illegal name, you get a syntax error. In

<p><code>76trombones</code> is illegal because it does not begin with a
letter. <code>more$</code> is illegal because it contains an illegal
character, the dollar sign. But what’s wrong with
<code>class</code>?</p>
<p>It turns out that <code>class</code> is one of the Python
<strong>keywords</strong>. Keywords define the language’s syntax rules
and structure, and they cannot be used as variable names. Python has
thirty-something keywords (and every now and again improvements to
Python introduce or eliminate one or two):</p>

<p>You might want to keep this list handy. If the interpreter complains
about one of your variable names and you don’t know why, see if it is on
this list.</p>
<p>Programmers generally choose names for their variables that are
meaningful to the human readers of the program — they help the
programmer document, or remember, what the variable is used for.</p>
<h2 id="statements-and-expressions">Statements and Expressions</h2>
<p>A <strong>statement</strong> is an instruction that the Python
interpreter can execute. We have only seen the assignment statement so
far. Some other kinds of statements that we’ll see shortly are
<code>while</code> statements, <code>for</code> statements,
<code>if</code> statements, and <code>import</code> statements. (There
are other kinds too!)</p>
<p>An <strong>expression</strong> is a combination of values, variables,
operators, and calls to functions. Expressions need to be evaluated. If
you ask Python to <code>print</code> an expression, the interpreter
<strong>evaluates</strong> the expression and displays the result.</p>

<p>In this example <code>len</code> is a built-in Python function that

<h3 id="example-15---evaluating-expressions">Example 15 - Evaluating
Expressions</h3>
<p>The <em>evaluation of an expression</em> produces a value, which is
why expressions can appear on the right hand side of assignment
statements. A value all by itself is a simple expression, and so is a
variable. Evaluating a variable gives the value that the variable refers
to.</p>

<p>Note that when we enter the assignment statement,
<code>y = 3.14</code>, only the prompt is returned. There is no value.
This is due to the fact that statements, such as the assignment
statement, do not return a value. They are simply executed.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the result of executing the assignment statement
is the creation of a reference from a variable, <code>y</code>, to a
value, <code>3.14</code>. When we execute the print function working on
<code>y</code>, we see the value that y is referring to. In fact,
evaluating <code>y</code> by itself results in the same response.</p>
<h2 id="operations-and-operands">Operations and Operands</h2>
<p><strong>Operators</strong> are special tokens that represent
computations like addition, multiplication and division. The values the
operator works on are called <strong>operands</strong>.</p>
<p>The following are all legal Python expressions whose meaning is more
or less clear::</p>
<pre><code>20 + 32
hour - 1
hour * 60 + minute
minute / 60
5 ** 2
(5 + 9) * (15 - 7)</code></pre>
<p>The tokens <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, and <code>*</code>, and
the use of parenthesis for grouping, mean in Python what they mean in
mathematics. The asterisk (<code>*</code>) is the token for
multiplication, and <code>**</code> is the token for exponentiation.
Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and exponentiation all do what
you expect.</p>

<h3 id="example-17---division-operator">Example 17 - Division
Operator</h3>
<p>When a variable name appears in the place of an operand, it is
replaced with the value that it refers to before the operation is
performed. For example, what if we wanted to convert 645 minutes into
hours. In Python 3, division is denoted by the operator token
<code>/</code> which always evaluates to a floating point result.</p>

<p>What if, on the other hand, we had wanted to know how many
<em>whole</em> hours there are and how many minutes remain. To help
answer this question, Python gives us a second flavor of the division
operator. This version, called <strong>integer division</strong>, uses
the token <code>//</code>. It always <em>truncates</em> its result down
to the next smallest integer (to the left on the number line).</p>

<p>Pay particular attention to the first two examples above. Notice that
the result of floating point division is <code>1.75</code> but the
result of the integer division is simply <code>1</code>. Take care that
you choose the correct flavor of the division operator. If you’re
working with expressions where you need floating point values, use the
division operator <code>/</code>. If you want an integer result, use
<code>//</code>.</p>
<h3 id="example-18---modulus-operator">Example 18 - Modulus
Operator</h3>
<p>The <strong>modulus operator</strong>, sometimes also called the
<strong>remainder operator</strong> or <strong>integer remainder
operator</strong> works on integers (and integer expressions) and yields
the remainder when the first operand is divided by the second. In
Python, the modulus operator is a percent sign (<code>%</code>). The
syntax is the same as for other operators.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb26"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb26-1"><a href="https://pages.mtu.edu/~lebrown/cs4821-cs5831-s24/Intro2Python/1-Learning-Python-with-your-first-notebook.html#cb26-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>quotient <span class="op">=</span> <span class="dv">7</span> <span class="op">//</span> <span class="dv">3</span>     <span class="co"># This is the integer division operator</span></span>

<p>In the above example, 7 divided by 3 is 2 when we use integer
division and there is a remainder of 1 when we use the modulus
operator.</p>
<p>The modulus operator turns out to be surprisingly useful. For
example, you can check whether one number is divisible by another—if
<code>x % y</code> is zero, then <code>x</code> is divisible by
<code>y</code>. Also, you can extract the right-most digit or digits
from a number. For example, <code>x % 10</code> yields the right-most
digit of <code>x</code> (in base 10). Similarly <code>x % 100</code>
yields the last two digits.</p>
<p>Finally, let’s look at an example with time, the remainder operator
is extremely useful for doing conversions, say from seconds, to hours,
minutes and seconds. If we start with a number of seconds, say 7684, the
following program uses integer division and remainder to convert to an
easier form. Step through it to be sure you understand how the division
and remainder operators are being used to compute the correct
values.</p>

<h2 id="input">Input</h2>
<p>The program in the previous section works fine but is very limited in
that it only works with one value for <code>total_secs</code>. What if
we wanted to rewrite the program so that it was more general. One thing
we could do is allow the user to enter any value they wish for the
number of seconds. The program could then print the proper result for
that starting value.</p>
<p>In order to do this, we need a way to get <strong>input</strong> from
the user. Luckily, in Python there is a built-in function to accomplish
this task. As you might expect, it is called <code>input</code>.</p>
<pre><code>n = input("Please enter your name: ")</code></pre>
<p>The input function allows the user to provide a <strong>prompt
string</strong>. When the function is evaluated, the prompt is shown.
The user of the program can enter the name and press
<code>return</code>. When this happens the text that has been entered is
returned from the <code>input</code> function, and in this case assigned
to the variable <code>n</code>. Make sure you run this example a number
of times and try some different names in the input box that appears.</p>

<p>It is very important to note that the <code>input</code> function
returns a string value. Even if you asked the user to enter their age,
you would get back a string like <code>"17"</code>. It would be your
job, as the programmer, to convert that string into an int or a float,
using the <code>int</code> or <code>float</code> converter functions we
saw earlier.</p>
<h3 id="example-20---input-number">Example 20 - Input Number</h3>
<p>To modify our previous program, we will add an input statement to
allow the user to enter the number of seconds. Then we will convert that
string to an integer. From there the process is the same as before. To
complete the example, we will print some appropriate output.</p>

<p>The variable <code>str_seconds</code> will refer to the string that
is entered by the user. As we said above, even though this string may be
<code>7684</code>, it is still a string and not a number. To convert it
to an integer, we use the <code>int</code> function. The result is
referred to by <code>total_secs</code>. Now, each time you run the
program, you can enter a new value for the number of seconds to be
converted.</p>
<h2 id="order-of-operations">Order of Operations</h2>
<p>When more than one operator appears in an expression, the order of
evaluation depends on the <strong>rules of precedence</strong>. Python
follows the same precedence rules for its mathematical operators that
mathematics does.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Parentheses have the highest precedence and can be used to force an
expression to evaluate in the order you want. Since expressions in
parentheses are evaluated first, <code>2 * (3-1)</code> is 4, and
<code>(1+1)**(5-2)</code> is 8. You can also use parentheses to make an
expression easier to read, as in <code>(minute * 100) / 60</code>, even
though it doesn’t change the result.</li>
<li>Exponentiation has the next highest precedence, so
<code>2**1+1</code> is 3 and not 4, and <code>3*1**3</code> is 3 and not
27. Can you explain why?</li>
<li>Multiplication and both division operators have the same precedence,
which is higher than addition and subtraction, which also have the same
precedence. So <code>2*3-1</code> yields 5 rather than 4, and
<code>5-2*2</code> is 1, not 6.</li>
<li>Operators with the <em>same</em> precedence (except for
<code>**</code>) are evaluated from left-to-right. In algebra we say
they are <em>left-associative</em>. So in the expression
<code>6-3+2</code>, the subtraction happens first, yielding 3. We then
add 2 to get the result 5. If the operations had been evaluated from
right to left, the result would have been <code>6-(3+2)</code>, which is
1.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong><br>
An exception to the left-to-right left-associative rule is the
exponentiation operator <code>**</code>. A useful hint is to always use
parentheses to force exactly the order you want when exponentiation is
involved:</p>

<h3 id="operator-precedence-table">Operator precedence table</h3>
<p>See Operation Table for <em>all</em> the operators introduced in this
book. You will also see many upcoming non-mathematical Python
operators.</p>
<p>The following table summarizes the operator precedence of Python
operators <em>in this book</em>, from highest precedence (most binding)
to lowest precedence (least binding). Operators in the same box have the
same precedence. Unless syntax is explicitly given, operators are
binary. Operators in the same box group left to right (except for
exponentiation, which groups from right to left). This is many of the
entries from the complete Python table at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#operator-precedence">https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#operator-precedence</a>.</p>
<p>In the row for comparisons, membership tests, and identity tests, all
have the same precedence and have a left-to-right chaining feature; for
example <code>3 &lt; x &lt;= y != z</code>.</p>

<p>The first time <code>bruce</code> is printed, its value is 5, and the
second time, its value is 7. The assignment statement changes the value
(the object) that <code>bruce</code> refers to.</p>
<p>Here is what <strong>reassignment</strong> looks like in a reference
diagram:</p>

<p>It is important to note that in mathematics, a statement of equality
is always true. If <code>a is equal to b</code> now, then
<code>a will always equal to b</code>. In Python, an assignment
statement can make two variables refer to the same object and therefore
have the same value. They appear to be equal. However, because of the
possibility of reassignment, they don’t have to stay that way:</p>

<p>Line 4 changes the value of <code>a</code> but does not change the
value of <code>b</code>, so they are no longer equal. We will have much
more to say about equality in a later chapter.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong><br>
In some programming languages, a different symbol is used for
assignment, such as <code>&lt;-</code> or <code>:=</code>. The intent is
that this will help to avoid confusion. Python chose to use the tokens
<code>=</code> for assignment, and <code>==</code> for equality. This is
a popular choice also found in languages like C, C++, Java, and C#.</p>
<h2 id="updating-variables">Updating Variables</h2>
<p>One of the most common forms of reassignment is an
<strong>update</strong> where the new value of the variable depends on
the old. For example,</p>
<pre><code>x = x + 1</code></pre>
<p>This means get the current value of x, add one, and then update x
with the new value. The new value of x is the old value of x plus 1.
Although this assignment statement may look a bit strange, remember that
executing assignment is a two-step process. First, evaluate the
right-hand side expression. Second, let the variable name on the
left-hand side refer to this new resulting object. The fact that
<code>x</code> appears on both sides does not matter. The semantics of
the assignment statement makes sure that there is no confusion as to the
result.</p>

<p>If you try to update a variable that doesn’t exist, you get an error
because Python evaluates the expression on the right side of the
assignment operator before it assigns the resulting value to the name on
the left. Before you can update a variable, you have to
<strong>initialize</strong> it, usually with a simple assignment. In the
above example, <code>x</code> was initialized to 6.</p>
<p>Updating a variable by adding 1 is called an
<strong>increment</strong>; subtracting 1 is called a
<strong>decrement</strong>. Sometimes programmers also talk about
<strong>bumping</strong> a variable, which means the same as
incrementing it by 1.</p>
